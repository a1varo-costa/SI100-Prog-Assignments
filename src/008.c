/**
 * 	Assignment 008 - Floyd's Triangle
 *
 * Floyd's Triangle is a triangular array of natural numbers. The lines are
 * filled with consecutive numbers, from 1 to N, as shown below for N = 3:
 * 
 * 	1
 * 	2 3
 * 	4 5 6
 * 
 * This program prints a slightly modified version of Floyd's Triangle. If
 * a line is even it is filled with 0s. Otherwise, 1s are used. When the
 * line is odd, it should be printed at the end how many numbers the line
 * has. At the end, the amount of 0s and 1s used is printed.
 *
 * Example (N = 3):
 *
 * 	1=1
 * 	0 0
 * 	1 1 1=3
 * 	6
